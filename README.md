I am an embedded systems engineering student at the National Institute of Applied Sciences and Technology.
I am at my graduation level, and I am looking for a final thesis project internship for 6 months starting from the 1st of February 2023.

I am interested in practicing my skills in embedded systems in the automotive field: electric vehicles, electro-mobility, motor control and dashboards.

In my GitHub account, I have uploaded the different projects that I have made during my life in IEEE RAS INSAT SBC, a robotics club in my Institute, some personal projects and professional ones.
