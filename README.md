I am an embedded systems engineering student at the National Institute of Applied Sciences and Technology. 

I am also an embedded software developer at Queen Cassiopeia.

I am fond of embedded systems and electronics, and especially when it is oriented to Automotive. 

In my GitHub account, I have uploaded the different projects that I have made during my life in IEEE RAS INSAT SBC, a robotics club in my Institute, some personal projects and professional ones.
